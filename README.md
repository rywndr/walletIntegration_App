## Thematic Bounty - Wallet Integration Tutorial

Bounty Overview:
In the world of Web3, onboarding users has always been crucial for the success of decentralized applications (dApps). However, it's no secret that the onboarding process can be quite challenging, especially for those who are new to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. 

To make matters more complex, many users might not be familiar with essential concepts like seed phrases, signing transactions, and managing cryptographic keys.

The intricacies of blockchains can act as a barrier, discouraging potential users from exploring the advantages of dApps. That's why we need to focus on creating a user-friendly and intuitive onboarding process, starting with wallets!

In this bounty, your mission is to delve into the wallet ecosystem and explore what are the available wallet solutions out there and identify which wallets best address the current onboarding problem in Web3. 

Next, select a wallet of your choice and curate an in depth wallet integration tutorial for developers to start integrating your chosen wallet solution to their applications!
